# Status

## Badges Applied For

### Available
Author-created artifacts placed on publicly accessible archival repository (Zenodo) with permanent DOI.

- **Public Repository**: Artifact available on Zenodo with [permanent DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18175468)
- **Archival Quality**: Repository has [declared plan](https://about.zenodo.org/policies/) for permanent accessibility
- **Paper Integration**: Same DOI will be referenced in the camera-ready paper

### Functional
Artifact is documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and includes appropriate evidence of verification and validation.

- **Documented**: Comprehensive README with installation, usage, and examples
- **Consistent**: All paper claims directly supported by runnable code and examples
- **Complete**: Full implementation of k-leg liability algorithm with all components
- **Exercisable**: Docker containerization ensures reproducible execution across platforms
- **Verified**: Includes a smoke test (`src/subprojects/liab/smoke-test.py`), unit tests for all the units (under `src/tests/`), and comparision table to verify the results of the paper in `README`

### Reusable
Artifact significantly exceeds minimal functionality - carefully documented and well-structured to facilitate reuse and repurposing.
- **Documentation**: All units are thoroughly documented using Python docstrings, with comprehensive README providing installation, usage, and API documentation
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with abstract base classes for extensible hierarchies
  - `SCMSystem`: Core structural causal model with component-based architecture
  - `Component`: Individual causal equations with symbolic expression support
  - `FailureSet`: Abstract base class for defining custom failure conditions
- **Extensibility**: Framework supports custom SCM systems, failure sets, and liability methods
  - Temporal systems with differential equations via `TemporalSCMSystem`
  - Custom failure sets, such as `ClosedHalfSpaceFailureSet` and `QFFOFormulaFailureSet`
  - Pluggable liability algorithms, such as `k_leg_liab` and `shapley_liab` 
- **Multiple Examples**: Diverse case studies demonstrating different usage patterns
- **Active Research Use**: Core classes currently used in multiple papers under review across causal analysis, metamorphic testing, and formal verification domains
