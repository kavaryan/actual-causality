## Badges Applied For

### Available ✓
Author-created artifacts placed on publicly accessible archival repository (Zenodo) with permanent DOI.

- **Public Repository**: Artifact available on Zenodo with permanent DOI
- **Archival Quality**: Repository has declared plan for permanent accessibility
- **Paper Integration**: Same DOI referenced in both artifact evaluation and camera-ready paper

### Functional ✓
Artifact is documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and includes appropriate evidence of verification and validation.

- **Documented**: Comprehensive README with installation, usage, and examples
- **Consistent**: All paper claims directly supported by runnable code and examples
- **Complete**: Full implementation of k-leg liability algorithm with all components
- **Exercisable**: Docker containerization ensures reproducible execution across platforms
- **Verified**: Includes smoke tests, property verification, and validation against paper results

### Reusable ✓
Artifact significantly exceeds minimal functionality - very carefully documented and well-structured to facilitate reuse and repurposing.

- **Exceptional Documentation**: API documentation, architectural overview, and extension guides
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with abstract base classes for extensible hierarchies
  - `SCMSystem`: Core structural causal model with component-based architecture
  - `FailureSet`: Abstract base class for defining custom failure conditions
  - `Component`: Individual causal equations with symbolic expression support
- **Extensibility**: Framework supports custom failure sets, liability methods, and SCM systems
  - Custom failure sets via `ClosedHalfSpaceFailureSet` and `QFFOFormulaFailureSet`
  - Pluggable liability algorithms (`k_leg_liab`, `shapley_liab`)
  - Temporal systems with differential equations via `TemporalSCMSystem`
- **Multiple Examples**: Diverse case studies demonstrating different usage patterns
- **Best Practices**: Type hints, comprehensive error handling, and professional code structure
- **Active Research Use**: Core classes currently used in multiple papers under review across causal analysis, metamorphic testing, and formal verification domains
